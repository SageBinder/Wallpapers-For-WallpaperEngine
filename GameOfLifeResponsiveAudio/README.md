# WallpaperEngine-Conway-Life-Audio-Responsive
This repository contains the code for my WallpaperEngine wallpaper. It runs Conway's Game of Life on the desktop wallpaper, but it differs from most other implementations by the fact that it creates new cells based on whatever audio your computer is playing.

Requires WallpaperEngine to use.
